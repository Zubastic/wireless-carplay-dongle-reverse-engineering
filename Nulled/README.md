### Nulled binaries (bypass activation)

Useful if you lost your original *uuid_sign* file (example : your Flash dump was corrupted or lost, you replaced the chip [..])

Install Custom Firmware and use SSH to:

 - Copy dummy *uuid_sign* to /etc
 - Replace *fakeiOSDevice* inside /usr/sbin by nulled one
 - Reboot

Enjoy !
