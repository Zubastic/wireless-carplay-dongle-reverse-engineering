### Custom Firmwares based on different stock firmwares

#### ⚠️ Carlinkit 1.0 / 2.0 / 3.0 only

#### ⚠️ You can only flash a custom firmware from a version strictly inferior to 2021.03.06, if not, please use a ROLLBACK firmware first

#### ℹ️ If you already use a custom firmware you must restore old unpacking binary ("Downgrade_2021.03.06" script) or use a ROLLBACK firmware

All custom firmwares restore "performance" scaling governor of the CPU, disable logging to save RAM and allow custom script execution from the USB Key :

    U2W.sh

### Warning !

There is **no warranty** of any kind with these custom firmwares, if you want to try it the best thing you can do is to flash the official firmware file before flashing the custom one (it is not preventing device bricking since it can happen with official files but at least you will not blame the custom firmware for this)
